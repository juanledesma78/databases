The schema "kinases_v3_schema.db" is created using the script "kinases_v3_schema.py", which uses SQLalchemy.

To see the relationships and the primary and foreign keys please see figures "ER kinases schema v3 All" and "ER kinases schema v3 Key", generated by DBeaver.

It consists of all the templates for the tables saved as classes. 
These templates are used to identify the featutres of the table (number of columns, datatype , length, special characters, relationships) and SQLalchemy finds or maps the databses according to this info.
In order to populate the data from csv files and to create queries in Flask, these templates must be included in the scripts to find the info, otherwise it would be impossible to locate the information in the database.
